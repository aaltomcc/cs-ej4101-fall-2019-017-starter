# This course

## Main chapter, why I decided to take this course
Main reason for takin this course was because it deals with DevOps.It is an issue which is quite obscure concept for me. I though that this course could be quite handy way to study DevOps related things.


## Chapter 2, What I have learned in this course
This is good course to get basic knowledge about DevOps. Theory in this course combined with offered (very many) links was quite comprehensive. Even thought this course is gives you only 1 ECT. I think that it is worth 2 ECT's.


## Chapter 3, The most challenging part of it
It was very challenging for me to understand all given instructions related to Github installation. I have never used GitHub in any way, so everything related to that was quite challenging.


## Chapter 4, What I have learned with this course
After all, I have learned quite a much. For example, the basics of GitHub and how it works in general. All this give me possibility to study more about DevOps. Now I have learned basics. I have noticed that expression DevOps is coming over and over again in job advertisements. I hope that I will later be in contact with it in practise. 


## Chapter 5, Least challenging part of this course
After all, when I managed to install GitHub related things properly and learn how to use it right, after that it was interesting to see how it really works. To write Markdown language was nice and easy and relaxing.
